# üñãÔ∏è Regeneration of Degraded Handwritten Kannada Letters Using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)

This project proposes a novel solution for restoring degraded handwritten Kannada characters using a **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)**. Degraded characters are reconstructed into clean, legible forms by conditioning the model on the target character label, enabling linguistically plausible and accurate restoration. This approach supports better OCR performance and aids in the preservation of cultural documents.

## üìå Key Features

- **CVAE Architecture**: Designed specifically for Kannada script restoration.
- **Conditional Restoration**: Utilizes target character labels for precise regeneration.
- **Script-Aware Reconstruction**: Learns to correct faded strokes or missing regions based on Kannada writing patterns.
- **Synthetic + Real Degradation**: Trained on both synthetic and real-world degraded data.
- **Supports OCR Systems**: Regenerated outputs improve HTR (Handwritten Text Recognition) accuracy.
